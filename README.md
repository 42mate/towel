Towel
=====

Towel is a PHP MVC framework designed to be very very easy to learn. It is built on top of Silex and Doctrine Dbal
and adds an extra layer to provide ease of integration and the capability to work like any MVC Framework.

Motivation
==========

* Almost all PHP Frameworks are very hard to learn for a newbie.
* Several frameworks follows a lot of theorethical concepts but become very impractical.
* We know that not all PHP Developers in the community are Computer Scientists.

* We hate updates that break everything every six months, we want long term support.
* NIH: Everybody has their own framework, we want our own.
* We are NOT fans of Java. 


What we did
=============

* Silex is great but is hard to maintain if the project start to grow.
* Dbal is great and solves 99.9 % of the database access problems.
* We just added a couple of classes to mix these great tools and make it more easy and standard for use.

What do we want ?
==============

* A framework easy to teach to new PHP Developer
* A framework that scale
* A framework driven by the Database and not by an Schema
* Keep it Simple, Stupid: not a lot of options, just the right options; not a lot of features, just the right features
