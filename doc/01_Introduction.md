Welcome to Towel
===============

Towel is a web framework that born inside of 42mate as an internal framework to develop applications. We are total aware about the bad side of have your own framework but we been working a long time with Symfony, Cake, Zend Fraeworkd, Drupal and Wordpress and we are kind of tired of the speed of changed in most of those framework, we can even complete to learn the whole framework, complete a work and bum !, the framwork have a new relase and everything have changed.

Whit Towel we want to create an easy to learn framework, with long term support, having the best things of others framworks and the most important, following the PHP philosophy because this framework is for PHP developers, not for Java, .NET or whatever other crap language.
